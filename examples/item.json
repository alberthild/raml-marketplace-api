  "description": "With its curved blade mimicking a tiger's claw, the karambit was developed as part of the southeast Asian martial discipline of silat. The knife is typically used with a reverse grip, with the finger ring on the index finger. It has been painted in a zebra-stripe pattern with aluminum and chrome paints with various reflectivities, and has then been covered with a tomato red candy coat.",

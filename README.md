# raml-marketplace-api

This is a simple API specification written in RAML which can be used to enable item trading
via online marketplace for any game which has items and inventories.

You can simply read the sources online or checkout and view it locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:alberthild/raml-marketplace-api.git
```

You can find information and tutorials about RAML on [raml.org](http://raml.org). I highly recommend using [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [API Wokrbench](http://apiworkbench.com/) to read, design and specify REST APIs.
